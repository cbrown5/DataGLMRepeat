# DataGLMRepeat: Tools that speed up the repetitive bits of GLMing

 CJ Brown  2020
 
 
Is the monotony of fitting GLM after GLM getting you down? DataGLMRepeat is here to help. 

This package includes tools for: 
- Calculating Dunn-Smyth residuals and a rootogram given observations and model predictions  
- Plotting a semivariogram with an arbitrary distance matrix  
- repeatedly fitting GLMs based on parameters and formulas given in a data frame. 
- And a range of other miscellaneous functions that Chris finds helpful for plotting 

To install this package use:

'remotes::install_github("cbrown5/DataGLMRepeat")

This package also has some vignette guides to model checking. 
I have endless troubles getting vignettes to work, but you can try: 

`remotes::install_github("cbrown5/DataGLMRepeat", build_vignettes = TRUE)`

Then to get started see `vignette("glm-model-checking")` and `vignette("with_groups")`. 

If the vignette's didn't install, then check out the .html files in the /vignettes directory. 
 
TODO:
Add vignette with advice on checking spatial residuals, 
including example with sf and generating model for spatial AC
